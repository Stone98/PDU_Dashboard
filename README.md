## Customization

### Modifying Thresholds
Edit the `thresholds` object in `script.js`:
```javascript
this.thresholds = {
    power: { warning: 25.6, critical: 30.4 },
    voltage: { low: 200, high: 240 },
    // ... other thresholds
};
```

### Adding Circuits
Modify the `circuitNames` array in the `generateCircuits()` method:
```javascript
const circuitNames = [
    'Server Rack A1-A5', 
    'Server Rack A6-A10',
    // Add more circuits here
];
```

### Updating Information Content
Edit the `infoPanelData` object in `script.js` to modify the educational content.
